api call in js
--------------

AJAX

-XMLhttp
-fetch
-asynch await

redirection in react
--------------------

react-router-dom
      -npm i react-router-router-dom

       import 
       { BrowserRouter as Router - all routing need components
         Routes                  - to set path for each component
         Route                   - more than one path 
         } from 'react-router-dom';

useParams  - hook used to access params from component url     

REDUX
-----

coupling - many connections between parent and child component

props drilling - in coupling , if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

for this react introduced a new technology - state management technology - REDUX 

redux process
-------------

create a new js file  to keep the states , all the components can access the json file 

- the components only can access the data from the js file but they cant update datas in js file 

Action -> a file with all the logics to update the state
Dispatch -> method used to dispatch the logic in action when the component need state updation
Reduce -> update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from action file

libraries used in redux
-----------------------
1- REDUX
2- REACT-REDUX
3- REDUX-THUNK

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

CreateStore() - method in REDUX used to create store in js file
              - 2 Args
              - 1 - reducer
              - 2 - middleware (used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous)

applyMiddleware - method in REDUX to apply middleware

combineReducers() - method in REDUX to combine all the reducers in js file

thunk - used to create middleware

1.create store 
2.apply the store in index.js  
    -provider - its a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)
